Description: |
  Add a customizable menu item to insert code and markdown snippets.
  Comes with extensive defaults for popular python modules, including fairly
  complete listings of many important functions and constants, to save
  searching through documentation.
Main: index.js
Compatibility: 4.x
Parameters:

- name: iais_snippets.insert_as_new_cell
  description: "Insert snippets as new cells, rather than at cursor inside current cell"
  input_type: checkbox
  default: false

- name: iais_snippets.sibling_selector
  description: |
    A JQuery selector for a sibling element next to whose parent element the
    new menu(s) will be inserted. Other suitable examples include '#file_menu',
    '#edit_menu', '#view_menu', '#insert_menu', '#cell_menu', and
    '#kernel_menu'. To append the new menu as a submenu to the 'insert' menu
    itself, you could use '#insert_menu>:last-child'.
  input_type: text
  default: '#help_menu'

- name: iais_snippets.insert_before_sibling
  description: |
    Insert the new menu(s) before their sibling (the default value of false
    means they are inserted after the sibling)
  input_type: checkbox
  default: false

- name: iais_snippets.top_level_submenu_goes_left
  description: |
    iais_snippets menus are often quite big, and positioned at the right side of the
    menu bar, so by default they open to the left of the menu. Set this to
    false to get them to open to the right as normal.
  input_type: checkbox
  default: true
